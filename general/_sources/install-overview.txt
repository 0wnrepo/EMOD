=====================
|EMOD_s| installation
=====================

.. remember that the Quick Start, using the EXE, and building from source have different prerequisites
.. and, therefore, different topics with instructions. Be sure to update all necessary files when
.. things change

|EMOD_l| can be installed on computers running |Windows_supp| or |Centos_supp|. For both operating
systems, there are relatively few prerequisites required and the |exe_l| or |linux_binary| is pre-
built from the latest |EMOD_s| source code release. After completing installation, you can run
simulations locally or on an HPC cluster using real-world data.

If you are not familiar with disease modeling, we recommend using the `training documentation`_ that
uses the |quick| with |Excel| to walk through several disease modeling tutorials before installing
and working directly with |EMOD_s|. You are also free to walk through those tutorials running
simulations directly with |EMOD_s| as described here.

If you want to download and modify the |EMOD_s| source code and build the |exe_s| or |linux_binary|
yourself, see :doc:`dev-install-overview`.
