Vector and malaria 5: Bednet distribution
=========================================

Beginning with this tutorial, you will be introduced to the procedure for layering campaign
:term:`intervention` events on top of the tutorials from the previous topics located in
:doc:`malaria-VM-tutorials-baseline-sim-scenarios`.

Use the config.json and campaign.json files in the following directory for this tutorial.

* Scenarios\VectorAndMalaria\05_Namawala_Vector_ITNs


Steps
=====

The disease simulation parameters of PrimaryScenarios_6_Namawala_Vector_ITNs are identical to the
ones used it the PrimaryScenarios_2B_Namawala3Vectors_highEIR scenario. However, in order to
configure the simulation to dispense campaign events, two parameters are modified.

.. literalinclude:: ../json/vm5-event-coordinator1.json
  :language: JSON

#.  Set the interventions.

    Change **Enable_Interventions** to 1 to enable the use of campaign interventions. You set this in the
    config.json file. This setting directs the simulation to look for the file
    specified in **Campaign_Filename** to define how campaign events are configured and distributed. For
    more information, see :ref:`config-simulationsetup` and :ref:`config-inputfiles` parameters.

#.  Set the fields in the campaign file as described below. For more information, see :ref:`ec-campaignevent`
    parameters.

    * Set **class** to "CampaignEvent."
    * Set **Nodeset_Config** to {"class": "NodeSetAll"}.
    * Set **Start_Day** to 1460.

#.  Set the **Event_Coordinator_Config**, which specifies which event coordinator class will handle the
    event, and then configures the coordinator in the campaign file.

    * Set **Demographic_Coverage** to 0.7.
    * Set **Target_Demographic** to "Everyone."

#.  Set the **Intervention_Config** object, which selects a class for the intervention and
    configures the parameters specific for that intervention class.

    Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs) are a key component of modern malaria control efforts and have
    recently been scaled up towards universal coverage in sub-Saharan Africa. Modern bednets are made
    of a polyethylene or polyester mesh which is impregnated with a slowly releasing pyrethroid
    insecticide. Mosquitoes that are seeking a blood meal will encounter a net, and if the net retains
    its physical integrity and has been correctly installed the feeding attempt is blocked.

    Blocked feeding attempts carry the possibility of killing the mosquito. Two efficacies are thus
    specified for bednets: the **Blocking_Config**, which sets the rate of blocking indoor feeds on
    individuals with an ITN, and **Killing_Config**, which sets the rate at which the mosquito dies
    conditional on a successfully blocked feed. The rate of blocking and killing both decay at a
    specified rate. For more information, see :ref:`iv-simplebednet` and :ref:`Waning effect <iv-waningeffect>`
    parameters.

    * Set the **Bednet_Type** as "ITN".
    * In **Blocking_Config**, set the **Initial_Effect** to 0.9 and **Decay_Time_Constant** to 730.
    * In **Killing_Config**, set the **Initial_Effect** to 0.6 and **Decay_Time_Constant** to 1460.



Run the simulation
==================

Run the simulation and generate graphs of the simulation output. For more information, see
:doc:`using-quickstart`.  Then, experiment with changing the durability profiles and efficacies.
