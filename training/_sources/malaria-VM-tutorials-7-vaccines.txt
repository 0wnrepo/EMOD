==================================================
Vector and malaria 7: Gametocyte-blocking vaccines
==================================================


This tutorial focuses on implementing a :term:`transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV)`. Altogether the campaign
template includes four events: :term:`insecticide-treated nets (ITN)`, :term:`indoor residual spraying (IRS)`,
:term:`pre-erythrocytic vaccine (PEV)` and TBV. Only the TBV event has a non-zero demographic coverage.
The other events are provided as additional examples for experimentation.


Use the config.json and campaign.json files in the following directory for this tutorial:

* 07_Namawala_Vector_SSV


Steps
=====

This event is based on the **Event_Coordinator_Config** parameters as set in
:doc:`malaria-VM-tutorials-6-bednets-vaccines`
with the following changes in the campaign file:

#.  For the "TransmissionBlocking" **SimpleVaccine** event, set the **Start_Day** to 1460.

#.  Make the following changes in the **Intervention_Config** to configure the last event with the
    **SimpleVaccine** class. For more information, see :ref:`SimpleVaccine <iv-simplevaccine>` parameters.

    * Set **Demographic_Coverage** to 0.85.
    * Set **Decay_Time_Constant** to 2190.
    * Set **Initial_Effect** to 0.9.
    * Set **Vaccine_Type** to "TransmissionBlocking."


Run the simulation
==================

Run the simulation and generate graphs of the simulation output. For more information, see
:doc:`using-quickstart`.  Experiment with the four events provided in
this tutorial to vary your results.
