If you encounter any of the following errors or problems when attempting to run simulations with
the |quick|, see the information below to resolve the issue.

Setenv.cmd is not recognized
============================

When you double-click the **EMOD Environment** shortcut to launch the command window, you may see
the following error with user-specific information displayed::

    '\\file.myRegion.myCompany\user2$\myUserName\EMOD-QuickStart-master'
    CMD.EXE was started with the above path as the current directory.
    UNC paths are not supported. Defaulting to Windows directory.
    'setenv.cmd' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

This error indicates that the |quick| was saved to a network directory. Move the |quick| to a locally
stored directory on your computer.

Code must be updated for 64-bit systems
=======================================

If you have a 64-bit version of Microsoft Excel installed, when you try to run the |Excel|, you will
see the following error:

    "The code in this project must be updated for use on 64-bit systems. Please review and update Declare
    Statements and then mark them with PtrSafe attribute."

Follow the steps below to work around this issue:

#.  Open EMOD_Macros.xlsm in Excel.
#.  On the **View** menu, in the **Macros** section, select **View Macros**.
#.  In the **Macro** window, select the TestingHelloWorld macro, and then click **Edit**.
#.  In the **Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications** window that opens, locate the lines that
    contain "Private Declare Function".
#.  Add the PtrSafe attribute by modifying these lines to "Private Declare PtrSafe Function".

Cannot open config.xlsm file in the |Excel|
===========================================

Excel will not open more than one file with the same name. In all of the training tutorials, the
configuration files for the |Excel| are named config.xlsm. If Excel will not open your
config.xlsm, make sure that you don't have a configuration file already open.
