=============================
Baseline simulation scenarios
=============================

Run the baseline scenario simulations to understand some of the basic features available in |EMOD_s|.
The baseline set includes scenarios for each of the generic :term:`SEIRS model`, vector-borne, and malaria disease
types as well as those that explore the impact of climate and migration on spatially distributed
simulations.

In this sections, you focus on the simulation :term:`configuration file`. The scenarios in
:doc:`malaria-VM-tutorials-scenarios-with-campaigns` focus on interventions and introduce the use of a
:term:`campaign file`.


The following scenarios are baseline simulation scenarios:
