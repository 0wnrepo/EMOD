============================
Vector and malaria tutorials
============================

These tutorials are separated into two categories: baseline simulation scenarios
and scenarios with campaigns. Baseline tutorials focus on simulation the spread of disease without
the use of interventions. Scenarios with campaigns focus on campaigns aimed at stopping the spread
of disease with one or more interventions. The tutorials are numbered in the order in which they should be read
while learning.
