Vector and malaria 1: Simple vector model
=========================================

In this tutorial you will configure and run a simple, three-species vector simulation in Namawala.
You will calculate the baseline EIR, and by varying the parameter **x_Temporary_Larval_Habitat**,
observe the dependence of EIR on larval habitat. (See Scaling Factors.)

Use the config.json and campaign.json in the following directories for this tutorial.

* Scenarios\VectorAndMalaria\01_A_Namawala3Vectors_lowEIR

* Scenarios\VectorAndMalaria\01_B_Namawala3Vectors_highEIR



Steps
=====

The config.json is set with the following default values. Optional settings are detailed in the
various tutorial steps.

#.  Set the parameter **Simulation_Type** to the value “VECTOR_SIM”.

    This vector model inherits the same human-infection model structure from the generic simulation
    type: uninfected, latent incubation, infectious, multiple immune variables, and super-infection.
    However, the transmission of infections is no longer between individual humans, but rather via the
    human-to-vector and vector-to-human pathways. The vector life cycle and feeding cycle in the
    model are described in the article `Eckhoff, Malaria Journal 2011,
    10:303 <http://www.malariajournal.com/content/10/1/303>`_. Also, see the `Larval Habitat`_ topic
    in the malaria documentation.

    .. _Larval Habitat: ./../malaria/malaria-larval-habitat.html

#.  Set the vector population.

    A separate **VectorPopulation** object is created for each vector species in the simulation.
    Modeling multiple vector species simultaneously allows for a mechanistic description of vector
    abundances and behavior through the effects of climate and weather on different preferred larval
    habitats. The three vector species present in this tutorial are *Anopheles arabiensis*, *Anopheles
    gambiae*, and *Anopheles funestus*, as these vectors drive most transmission in the Namawala region.
    *An. funestus* has more relative importance during the dry season, but *An. arabiensis* and *An.
    gambiae* combined carry most of the annual transmission. For more information, see :ref:`config-vector`
    parameters.

    Set the vector population with the following parameters:


    * Set **Vector_Sampling_Type** to "VECTOR_COMPARTMENTS NUMBER"
    * Set **Vector_Species_Names** to "arabiensis," "funestus," "gambiae"



#.  Set **Enable_Interventions** to 0 to run a baseline simulation with no public health campaign. For
    more information, see :ref:`config-simulationsetup` parameters.




#.  Set the incubation period.

    The incubation period **Incubation_Period_Distribution** is set to “FIXED_DURATION” and
    **Base_Incubation_Period** is set to 25 days corresponding to the duration from an infectious mosquito
    bite to the development of sufficiently numerous gametocytes to infect mosquitoes. For more
    information, see :ref:`config-generaldisease` parameters.

#.  Set the infectious period with the following parameters:


    * Set **Base_Infectious_Period** to 180.
    * Set **Base_Infectivity** to 1.
    * Set **Base_Mortality** to 0.
    * Set **Enable_Superinfection** to 1.
    * Set **Infectious_Period_Distribution** to "EXPONENTIAL_DURATION."

#.  Configure the vector species parameters.

    The vector species parameters described in the article `Eckhoff, Malaria Journal 2011,
    10:303 <http://www.malariajournal.com/content/10/1/303>`__ are
    specified for each species present in the simulation. For more information, see
    :ref:`config-vectorspecies` and :ref:`config-scalingfactors` parameters.


    * Set **Acquire_Modifier** to 0.2.
    * Set **Adult_Life_Expectancy** to 10.
    * Set **Anthropophily** to 0.95.
    * Set **Aquatic_Arrhenius1** to 84200000000.
    * Set **Aquatic_Arrhenius2** to 8328.
    * Set **Aquatic_Mortality_Rate** to 0.1.
    * Set **Days_Between_Feeds** to 3.
    * Set **Egg_Batch_Size** to 100.
    * Set **Immature_Duration** to 2.
    * Set **Indoor_Feeding_Fraction** to 1.
    * Set **Infected_Arrhenius1** to 117000000000.
    * Set **Infected_Arrhenius2** to 8336.
    * Set **Infected_Egg_Batch_Factor** to 0.8.
    * Set **Infectious_Human_Feed_Moratality_Factor** to 1.5.
    * Set **Larval_Habitat_Types** to "TEMPORARY_RAINFALL": 11250000000.
    * Set **Transmission_Rate** to 0.5.
    * Set **x_Temporary_Larval_Habitat** to 0.1.


.. warning::

  The above settings are for *An. arabiensis* vector population, but settings are
  different for the other species. These are noted in detail within the configuration file under the
  **Vector_Species_Params** parameter.
