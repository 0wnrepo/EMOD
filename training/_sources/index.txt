============================
Welcome to |EMOD_s| training
============================

The |IDM_l| develops complex software modeling. The primary software, |EMOD_l|, helps determine the
combination of health policies and intervention strategies that can lead to disease eradication. We
share this modeling software with the research community to advance the understanding of disease
dynamics.

However, if you are not already familiar with epidemiology and disease modeling, it can be
challenging to get started with |EMOD_s|. This training documentation provides extensive tutorials
that walk you through prepared modeling scenarios. In addition, you can easily run simulations with
the |quick| using the provided Windows batch files or within the familiar interface of the |Excel|.

Documentation structure
=======================

|IDM_s| recently separated the documentation into this training set and disease-specific sets that
provide guidance for researchers modeling particular diseases. If you already have disease modeling
experience, we recommend using the documentation that corresponds to disease you study or, if you
want to extend the software to study another disease, the `general disease`_ documentation set.
