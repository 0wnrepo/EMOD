Vector and malaria 11: Linear combination vector habitat
========================================================


In this tutorial, you will configure and run a species vector simulation in Namawala where the
vectors reside in more than one habitat.

This tutorial, investigating a linear-combination habitat, is important because in many cases, a
mosquito species will not be characterized by a single type of habitat. Rather a mosquito species
may predominantly use a single habitat type, but also make use of other habitat types as available.
The linear-combination habitat models allow you much more control over local vector ecology,
especially in dry seasons.


Use the config.json and campaign.json in the following directory for this tutorial.

* Scenarios\VectorAndMalaria\11_MultipleLarvalHabitats


Steps
=====

The configuration file is set with default values described below. Optional settings are detailed in the
various tutorial steps.

#.  Set the habitat parameters as shown below. For more information, see :ref:`config-vector` parameters.

    The following details the parameter configuration in the config.json file for the species that
    is present in this simulation, *An. arabiensis.*

    * Set **Larval_Habitat_Types** to {"TEMPORARY_RAINFALL": 11250000000, "WATER_VEGETATION": 6000000000}.
    * Set **Vector_Species_Names** to "arabiensis."


#.  The campaign uses oviposition traps that target only the water-vegetation habitat. Set the
    campaign file parameters as shown below.

    * Set **Initial_Effect** to 0.95.
    * Set **Decay_Time_Constant** to 2190.
    * Set **Habitat_Target** to "WATER_VEGETATION".

Run the simulation
==================

Run the simulation and generate graphs of the simulation output. For more information, see
