Vector and malaria 3: Impact of climate on seasonality
======================================================

Compare impact of climate on seasonality and run a simple vector model in Namawala, Muheza, and
Garki single-node. In this next tutorial, we now move out from Namawala to explore the impact of
different locations and weather patterns.


Use the config.json and campaign.json files in the following directories for this tutorial:

* Scenarios\VectorAndMalaria\03_A_Namawala_Vector

* Scenarios\VectorAndMalaria\03_B_Muheza_Vector

* Scenarios\VectorAndMalaria\03_C__Garki_single_node_Vector




Steps
=====

The files in this tutorial are set up to use the demographic and weather files for
Namawala, Tanzania in the 1990s, Muheza, Tanzania in the 2000s, and Garki, Nigeria in the early
1970s. The values are set in the config.json file.

#.  Follow the steps detailed in :doc:`malaria-VM-tutorials-1-simple`.

#.  **Enable_Interventions** remains set to 0 to run a baseline simulation with no public health
    campaign. For more information, see :ref:`config-simulationsetup` parameters.

Run the simulation
==================

Run the simulation and generate graphs of the simulation output. For more information, see
:doc:`using-quickstart`. Compare the impact of climate on seasonality with a simple vector model in
Namawala, Muheza, and Garki single-node geographies. The differences among the three locations go
beyond the differences in annual :term:`entomological inoculation rate (EIR)`. The dry season is
much drier in Garki compared to Namawala, and thus the depth of the low transmission season is
lower. This causes a stronger variation in human infection in Garki, especially if the tutorial is
re-run with the full malaria microsolvers.
