==========================
Install the |quick|
==========================

.. remember that the Quick Start, using the EXE, and building from source have different prerequisites
.. and, therefore, different topics with instructions. Be sure to update all necessary files when
.. things change

The |quick| contains a pre-built :term:`Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD)` executable called
:term:`Eradication.exe`. It also contains directories for many different real-world scenarios that
you can model, each of which includes the necessary :term:`input data files`, :term:`configuration
file`, and :term:`campaign file`. You can easily run simulations with the provided Windows batch
files or within the familiar interface of the |Excel|.

After you complete installation, we recommend that you walk through the tutorials that describe the
underlying mathematics of |EMOD_s|, starting with the generic tutorials that demonstrate the basic
:term:`SEIR model` framework before moving on to the disease-specific tutorials.

.. include:: ../reuse/note-quickstart.txt

Download the |quick|
====================

#.  Go to the `EMOD-QuickStart`_ GitHub repository.

#.  From the **Clone or download** menu, select **Download ZIP**.

#.  On your local computer, download and unzip the file to a location of your choice.

.. warning::

    You must not save the |quick| to a network drive or include any spaces in the path to the
    location or the environment setup will fail.

.. _EMOD-QuickStart: https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/EMOD-QuickStart.git

Within the EMOD-QuickStart-master directory, you will see |exe_s|, the |EMOD_s| application, various
files for setting up the environment and running simulations, and the Scenarios directory, which
contains all required files for modeling various scenarios described in the tutorials.

Within the Scenarios directory, each subdirectory corresponds to a tutorial section and contains the
scenarios associated with those tutorials. The exceptions to this rule are EmbeddingPython, which
does not yet have tutorials, InputFiles, which contains the :term:`input data files` used by all
scenarios, and Scripts, which contains the scripts used to plot the simulation output.

.. TBD add the embedded python info

Set up the |quick| environment
==============================

The |quick| assumes all directories are located on the virtual Z drive, regardless of where you
physically save them. The following setup script configures environment variables so that the tools,
such as the |Excel|, can access the correct location.

#.  Open the EMOD-QuickStart-master directory.

#.  Double-click the **EMOD Environment** shortcut to launch the command window in the virtual Z drive.
    If a Security Warning appears, click **Open** to ignore it.

    This runs the setenv.bat file, which temporarily sets up the Path and
    Python\_Path environment variables.

#.  From the command line, enter ``dir``. The directories and files will be listed if the environment
    is correctly set up.

    If the directories and files are not listed, this indicates that your virtual Z drive is
    already being used. Use the steps below to select another virtual drive and update some of the
    |quick| files to use the other virtual drive.

(Optional) Set up a different virtual drive
-------------------------------------------

In following example, the |quick| is edited to use the virtual drive A. Modify the instructions
as necessary if you want to use a different virtual drive.

#.  Open the EMOD-QuickStart-master directory.

#.  In the setenv.cmd script, replace all occurrences of "Z" with "A".

#.  In the emod.bat script, replace all occurrences of "Z" with "A".

#.  In each scenario directory, in each Excel configuration file, in cell B2 of the Commissioning
    sheet, replace "Z" with "A".

#.  If you want to use embedded Python, in Scenarios\EmbeddingPython, in the emod.bat script, replace
    all occurrences of "Z" with "A".

After updating the files to the virtual drive A, double-click the **EMOD Environment** shortcut to
see if the command window opens in the virtual drive A and displays the |quick| directories and
files.

(Optional) Install plotting software
====================================

None of the following plotting software is required to run simulations with the |quick|, but
they are useful for creating graphs from and evaluating the model output.

When you install the |quick|, Python and and the package manager, pip, is also installed. When you
run |quick| simulations, the |quick| automatically runs Python scripts to create graphs of the
output. These scripts also require you to install the software packages listed below. However, most
of these graphs are reproduced in the documentation if you do not want to install additional
software to create the graphs yourself.

Note that all batch files assume that Python is installed at C:\Python27. If you already have Python
installed in a different location, use a plain text editor to modify the path in the batch files.

.. In addition, many of the HIV and STI tutorials use the plotting software R, MATLAB, and
.. Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox to create graphs.

.. include:: ../reuse/gohlke.txt

Python utilities
----------------

The |quick| Python scripts require the Python utilities dateutil, six, and pyparsing.

.. include:: ../reuse/python-utility-install.txt

NumPy
-----

The |quick| Python scripts require the NumPy Python package.

.. include:: ../reuse/numpy-install.txt

Matplotlib
----------

The |quick| Python scripts require the matplotlib Python library.

.. include:: ../reuse/matplotlib-install.txt

.. TODO add instructions for R, MATLAB, and Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox once the HIV
.. and STI tutorials are added
