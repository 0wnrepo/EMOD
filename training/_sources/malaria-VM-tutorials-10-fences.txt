Vector and malaria 10: Insect-killing fence
===========================================

The **InsectKillingFence** is a node-targeted intervention that is any sort of fence-like system
designed to stop insects, such as mosquitoes. For example, you could create an insect-killing fence
by stringing together a series of bednets. The mode-of-action is the killing of the specified
fraction of all feeding mosquitoes both at the beginning and at the end of the feeding cycle.

While the idea of an insect-killing fence (especially a photonic fence) is interesting in and of
itself, the real focus of this tutorial concerns its use. Namely, this is an intervention that can
kill mosquitoes outdoors both on their way in to feed and on their way out to oviposit.

Steps
=====

#.  In the campaign file, in **Intervention_Config**, set **class** to "InsectKillingFence".
#.  Set **Start_Day** to 1460. For more information, see :ref:`ec-campaignevent` parameters.
#.  Set the following parameters in the intervention. For more information, see :ref:`iv-insectkillingfence`
    and :ref:`Waning effect <iv-waningeffect>` parameters.

    * Set **Cost_To_Consumer** to 3.75.
    * In **Killing_Config**, set **Initial_Effect** to 0.28.
    * Set **Decay_Time_Constant** to 2190.
