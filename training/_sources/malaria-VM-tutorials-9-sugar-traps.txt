Vector and malaria 9: Sugar-baited traps
========================================

The sugar-baited traps tutorial introduces a new vector-life cycle targeting intervention, the
:term:`sugar-baited trap` or attracting toxic sugar bait. This is a node-level intervention of class
**SugarTrap**.


Use the config.json and campaign.json in the following directory for this tutorial.

* Scenarios\VectorAndMalaria\09_Namawala_Vector_SugarBaitedTraps


Steps
=====

#.  In the config.json file, set the following parameters. For more information, see :ref:`config-vector` parameters.


    * Set **Vector_Sampling_Type** to "TRACK_ALL_VECTORS."
    * Set **Vector_Sugar_Feeding_Frequency** to "VECTOR_SUGAR_FEEDING_EVERY_DAY."

#.  In the campaign.json file, set the following parameters. For more information, see
    :ref:`iv-sugartrap` and :ref:`Waning effect <iv-waningeffect>` parameters.

    * Set **class** to "SugarTrap".
    * Set **Start_Day** to 1460.
    * Set **Cost_To_Consumer** to 3.75.
    * In **Killing_Config**, set **Initial_Effect** to 0.1 and **Decay_Time_Constant** to 2190.


Run the simulation
==================

Run the simulation and generate graphs of the simulation output. For more information, see
:doc:`using-quickstart`.  Compare to baseline and bednets alone after running the simulation.
